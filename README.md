This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# About the App

__Developers:__ Darren Zhang, Eva Yan, Isabella Berekdar, Samson Wu <br />
__Timeframe:__ 5-7 days <br /> 
__Date:__ January 2020 <br /> 
__Program:__ CUNY 2X/TTP Winter 2020 Cohort <br /> 
__Link to Back-end Repo:__ https://github.com/isabellaberekdar/Student-Campus-Manager-Backend

This web application uses Node, Express, React, Redux, PostgreSQL, and Sequelize, to build a RESTful full-stack web application to manage students and campuses. This will cover all of the CRUD operations such as Creation, Reading, Updating, and Deletion. This will encompass models, querying a database with an ORM, designing routes/endpoints and handler functions to process user requests and generate responses, writing out React Components, managing the state of the application with React-Redux, and much more. This will also involve having two individual repositories/applications (a separate server and a separate client), which encourages separation of concerns and modularity. 

Below are some __UI wireframes__ made pre-development that present the layout and concept of the app that we followed while developing the application.

# Scripts and Running the App

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
